I'm Angelo Lebrilla, a 3rd year student of Samar State University taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and this is my ORACIO mobile application journey

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to track my progress in developing the ORACIO Mobile Application, which focuses on daily prayers, meditation, and contemplation. By setting clear milestones and deadlines, I aim to ensure that each phase of the development process, from planning to deployment, is well-structured and achievable.
